The website can be viewed at this link (https://linalg-det-calc.pages.dev).

The whole determinant logic is at `src/lib/determinant.ts`.

## How To Compile

1. Install Node (Skip if you already have Node)

```
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS
```

2. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/Linueue/linalg-determinant-calc-js.git
```

3. Go to the repo's directory

```
cd linalg-determinant-calc-js
```

4. Install all dependencies

```
npm install
```

5. Compile to a single .HTML file

```
