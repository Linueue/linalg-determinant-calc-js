# Determinant Calculator

## Using Cofactor Expansion

The website can be viewed at this link (https://linalg-det-calc.pages.dev).

This is the source code for BSCS 2-3 Math 206 Final Project of Determinant Calculator using cofactor expansion.

- The whole determinant logic is found at `src/lib/determinant.ts`.
- Everything else in `src/` is for UI logic, where `src/App.svelte` is the main entry point of the website.
- Everything else beside the `src/` folder is the config files.
